		  <h6>Couples: get the wedding of your dreams completely free!</h6>
		  <p>Weddings are expensive.  Even a modest event starts at $20,000 and it only goes up from there.  Trying to use your own money or go into debt to finance your event is not the best financial move.  What if you could still have the wedding of your dream, but save your money for a down payment on a house?  Or a <a href="http://www.neckerisland.com/" target="_new">honeymoon vacation</a>.</p>
		  <p>Having a corporate sponsor for your wedding is easy with Sponsored Weddings.  We match couples looking to get married with businesses looking to advertise at the event and cover the cost.  Maybe you've been to a sporting event at a stadium named for a corporate sponsor?  It's the same concept but on a smaller scale.  (Well depends on the wedding, if your guest list is going to fill a stadium it's the same scale!)</p>

		  <h6>Businesses: spend your advertising dollars on an event that can last forever.</h6>
		  <p>Advertising is changing.  What can $20,000 get your business?  A small newspaper ad no one will see?  Some clicks on Google ad words that might be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click_fraud" target="_new">click-fraud</a>?  Let's not even talk about television commercials in the age of tivo.  Advertising is becoming personal.  Sponsor a wedding and not only do you get a captive audience for the event, but you get a life-long connection with every person involved.  When making buying decisions in the future, every wedding guest will remember the sponsor and choose their product over the competition.</p>
		  <p>You get your business name and logo in every photograph.  You get a special thank you from the family during the speeches.  You can send a representative to attend if desired and make a speech on behalf of your company as well.</p>
